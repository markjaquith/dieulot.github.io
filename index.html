<h3>What is it</h3>

<p>InstantClick is a JavaScript library that dramatically speeds up your website, making navigation effectively instant in most cases.

<h3>Why</h3>

<p>Despite the huge bandwidth increases, websites don’t get much faster. This is because the biggest botteneck in loading web pages is latency.<sup id="note-latency-back"><a href="#note-latency">1</a></sup>

<h3>How does it work</h3>

<p>Latency is inevitable with today’s internet architecture so InstantClick cheats by preloading links you are likely to click on.

<p>Before a visitor clicks on a link, he hovers over that link. Between these two events, 200 ms to 300 ms usually pass by (<a href="click-test.html">test yourself here</a>). InstantClick makes use of that time to preload the page, so that the page is already there when you click.

<p>If you want your website to not be flooded by requests, you can set a delay before preloading starts when a user hovers a link. It will still <a href="http://www.nngroup.com/articles/response-times-3-important-limits/" title="Jakob Nielsen – Response Times: The 3 Important Limits" target="_blank">feel instant</a>.

<p>If you really don’t want any wasted request, you may preload on “mousedown”. This is when you press your mouse button (a click is when you release it).

<hr>

<p>InstantClick uses pushState and Ajax, a combo known as <a href="https://github.com/defunkt/jquery-pjax" target="_blank">pjax</a>.

<p>Ajax brings two nice benefits in and of itself:
<ul>
  <li>Your browser doesn’t have to throw and recalculate styles and scripts every time you go to another page.
  <li>You don’t get a white flash while your browser is waiting for a page to display, making your website <em>feel</em> faster.
</ul>

<p>If your browser doesn’t <a href="http://caniuse.com/#search=pushstate" target="_blank">support pushState</a>, InstantClick fully degrades.

<h3>Getting started</h3>

<p>Head to the <a href="start.html">Getting started</a> page.

<h3>What’s coming next</h3>

<p>By decreasing order of priority:
<ul>
  <li>Preloading on “touchstart”, so that mobile devices can preload too.
  <li>Adding a progress bar (in the spirit of <a href="http://ricostacruz.com/nprogress/" target="_blank">NProgress</a>), for those users that have a slow connection.
  <li>Getting statistics on how much additional load InstantClick puts on a server.
</ul>
